  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "The proliferation score is low, which suggests a slower-growing tumor.",
    "The stemness score is high, suggesting the presence of cancer stem cells that are characteristic of the embryonal subtype.",
    "The immune infiltration score is high, indicating a strong immune response to the tumor, which is often seen in more aggressive subtypes like embryonal.",
    "The prognostic score is low, suggesting a better overall prognosis."

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of cancer stem cells.",
    "Conduct functional assays to assess the proliferative capacity of the tumor cells.",
    "Investigate the immune response in more detail, for example by characterizing the infiltrating immune cell types.",
    "Validate the prognostic score with clinical follow-up data."
