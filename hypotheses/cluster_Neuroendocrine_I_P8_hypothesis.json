  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "The proliferation score is very low, indicating that the cells in this cluster are not actively dividing.",
    "The stemness score is very high, which is characteristic of embryonal subtype that is known to have a high degree of stemness.",
    "The immune infiltration score is very low, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment is not highly infiltrated by immune cells.",
    "The prognostic score is low, suggesting a better prognosis for this subtype."

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of top genes.",
    "Conduct in vitro differentiation assays to confirm the high stemness score.",
    "Carry out immune profiling to validate the low immune score.",
    "Perform survival analysis to validate the low prognostic score."
