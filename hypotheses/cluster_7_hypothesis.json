  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "TFRC, STMN1, and TUBB are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, common in fetal subtype.",
    "FST is involved in growth regulation, a feature of fetal subtype.",
    "HBG1 and HBG2 are fetal hemoglobin genes, indicating a more immature, fetal-like state.",
    "SERPINI1 and FGL2 are associated with coagulation and inflammation, common in fetal subtype.",
    "EPB41 is involved in cell shape changes, common in fetal subtype.",
    "MYH7B is a myosin gene, often upregulated in muscle tissue, consistent with the mesenchymal component of fetal subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry for TFRC, STMN1, TUBB, FST, HBG1, HBG2, SERPINI1, FGL2, EPB41, MYH7B to confirm protein expression.",
    "Perform functional assays to assess the role of these genes in cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth regulation.",
    "Investigate the role of these genes in coagulation and inflammation in hepatoblastoma.",
    "Perform single-cell RNA sequencing on other hepatoblastoma subtypes for comparison."
