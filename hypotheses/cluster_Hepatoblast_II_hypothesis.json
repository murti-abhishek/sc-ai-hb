  "PrognosticScore": "0.314",
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Proliferation score is low, suggesting a slower growing tumor.",
    "Stemness score is intermediate, indicating a mixed population of differentiated and stem-like cells, consistent with a mixed subtype.",
    "High immune infiltration score suggests the presence of immune cells within the tumor, which could be a response to tumor antigens.",
    "Prognostic score is low, indicating a better prognosis for this tumor subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of immune cells within the tumor.",
    "Conduct functional assays to assess the proliferative capacity of the tumor cells.",
    "Perform in vitro differentiation assays to confirm the stem-like properties of the tumor cells."
