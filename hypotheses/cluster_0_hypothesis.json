  ],
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "AFP and DLK1 are markers of fetal liver cells and their high expression suggests a fetal subtype.",
    "APOB, APOM, APOA2 are involved in lipid metabolism, a characteristic feature of fetal hepatocytes.",
    "AHSG, ITIH2, SERPINA1, and SPINK1 are associated with serum protein synthesis, another feature of fetal hepatocytes."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of these genes at the protein level.",
    "Carry out functional assays to understand the role of these genes in tumor biology.",
    "Investigate the mutational status of these genes in the tumor cells."
