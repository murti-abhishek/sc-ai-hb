  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "High proliferation score (1.000) suggests rapid cell division, typical of embryonal subtype.",
    "Intermediate stemness score (0.342) indicates some cells may retain pluripotency, also characteristic of embryonal subtype.",
    "Intermediate immune infiltration score (0.404) may suggest some immune response, but not enough to classify as macrotrabecular subtype.",
    "Low prognostic score (0.069) indicates a relatively good prognosis, which is more common in embryonal subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm embryonal subtype markers.",
    "Conduct functional assays to validate stemness properties.",
    "Perform sequencing of immune cell repertoire to better understand immune infiltration.",
    "Validate prognostic score with clinical follow-up data."
