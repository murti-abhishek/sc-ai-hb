    "SRGN",
    "IL8",
    "HBB",
    "FTH1",
    "IL1B",
    "HLA-B",
    "S100A9",
    "B2M",
    "CTSB",
    "MT-CO1"
  ],
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "SRGN is known to be involved in cell proliferation and migration, which is characteristic of embryonal subtype.",
    "IL8 and IL1B are pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting an immune response which is often seen in embryonal subtype.",
    "HBB, FTH1, and MT-CO1 are involved in cellular metabolism and oxygen transport, which are crucial for rapidly dividing cells in embryonal subtype.",
    "HLA-B, B2M, and S100A9 are involved in immune response, suggesting a possible immune infiltration in the tumor environment, a feature of embryonal subtype.",
    "CTSB is a lysosomal protease involved in protein degradation and is often upregulated in aggressive tumors, supporting the embryonal subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to validate the expression of these genes at the protein level.",
    "Perform functional assays to understand the role of these genes in tumor progression.",
    "Investigate the immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing.",
    "Validate these findings in a larger cohort of hepatoblastoma patients."
