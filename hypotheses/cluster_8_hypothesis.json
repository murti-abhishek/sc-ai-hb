    "MYH7B",
    "MATN3",

  ],
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "BMP4 is involved in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, suggesting an embryonal subtype.",
    "ROBO1 and NRP2 are associated with axon guidance during embryonic development, further supporting the embryonal subtype.",
    "APCDD1 and ZNRF3 are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in embryonal tumors."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of these genes at the protein level.",
    "Investigate the activation status of the Wnt signaling pathway in this cluster.",
    "Perform in vitro differentiation assays to confirm the embryonal phenotype."
