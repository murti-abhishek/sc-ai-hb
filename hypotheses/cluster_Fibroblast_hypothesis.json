  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "The proliferation score is low (0.180), suggesting that the cells in this cluster are not rapidly dividing. This is consistent with the fibroblast identity of the cluster, as fibroblasts are typically not highly proliferative.",
    "The stemness score is high (0.907), indicating that the cells in this cluster have a high degree of pluripotency. This is unusual for fibroblasts, and suggests that these cells may have undergone some form of dedifferentiation or transformation.",
    "The immune infiltration score is intermediate (0.476), suggesting a moderate level of immune cell infiltration into the tumor. This could be indicative of an ongoing immune response to the tumor.",
    "The prognostic signature score is low (0.116), suggesting a relatively good prognosis for this tumor. This is consistent with the low proliferation score, as less aggressive tumors tend to have lower proliferation rates."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of fibroblast markers in the tumor cells.",
    "Perform functional assays to assess the pluripotency of the tumor cells.",
    "Perform flow cytometry to quantify the extent of immune cell infiltration into the tumor.",
    "Perform a longitudinal study to monitor the progression of the tumor over time and validate the prognostic score."
