  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Strong ECM/mesenchymal program with collagens (COL1A1/1A2/3A1/5A2/6A1/6A2/6A3), matricellular proteins (SPARC, POSTN), and proteoglycans (DCN, LUM, VCAN), typical of mesenchymal components in mixed hepatoblastoma.",
    "Vimentin (VIM) and IGFBP5 support fibroblast/myofibroblast or mesenchymal differentiation.",
    "CXCL14 is commonly secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts/stellate cells, aligning with a mixed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal context.",
    "Absence of hepatocytic/fetal markers (e.g., ALB, AFP, APO genes) and lack of prominent cell-cycle drivers (e.g., MKI67, TOP2A) argues against pure fetal or embryonal subtypes; no clear macrotrabecular angiogenic/endothelial signature."

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF for VIM, COL1A1/COL1A2, POSTN, DCN/LUM, and ACTA2 (\u03b1-SMA) to confirm mesenchymal/CAF phenotype.",
    "Co-stain for epithelial markers (EPCAM, KRT8/18, AFP) to assess mixed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal composition.",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex RNA ISH (e.g., RNAscope for COL1A1/POSTN/CXCL14) to localize ECM-rich cells and architecture.",
    "Infer CNVs from scRNA profiles to distinguish malignant mesenchymal cells from stromal CAFs; validate with FISH if needed.",
    "Masson's trichrome or Sirius Red staining to quantify collagen deposition."
