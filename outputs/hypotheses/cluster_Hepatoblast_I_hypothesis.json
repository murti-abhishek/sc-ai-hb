  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Low proliferation score indicates slow tumor growth.",
    "No stemness score suggests lack of stem cell-like properties, which is consistent with the fetal subtype.",
    "Intermediate immune infiltration score suggests some immune response, but not a highly inflamed tumor environment.",
    "Intermediate prognostic score indicates moderate risk, which is consistent with the generally better prognosis of the fetal subtype.",
    "Upregulation of genes such as FGA, FGG, APOE, and CYP2E1, which are associated with mature liver functions, supports the fetal subtype assignment."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of top marker genes at the protein level.",
    "Conduct in vitro proliferation assays to validate the low proliferation score.",
    "Perform single-cell RNA sequencing on additional samples to validate the subtype assignment."
