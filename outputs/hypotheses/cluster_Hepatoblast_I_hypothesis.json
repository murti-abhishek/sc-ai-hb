  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Enrichment of hepatocyte secretory/plasma proteins (FGA/FGB/FGG, F5, HP, ITIH1, VTN, AMBP) consistent with differentiated liver function",
    "High apolipoprotein and transport gene expression (APOE, APOC3, AFM) typical of hepatocyte-like maturation",
    "Strong metabolic/mitochondrial-hepatocyte program (CPS1, HMGCS2, ACADVL, GLUL, AOX1, CYP2E1) aligning with more differentiated fetal-type hepatoblastoma",
    "Presence of complement component C3 and kininogen KNG1 further supports a mature hepatocytic secretory phenotype",
    "Lack of classic embryonal/stem/proliferation markers among top genes (e.g., EPCAM, AFP, MKI67, TOP2A)"
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF for hepatocyte differentiation markers (CPS1, HMGCS2, GLUL, CYP2E1, HNF4A) and fibrinogen to validate mature hepatocytic identity",
    "Assess embryonal features by IHC for EPCAM, AFP, GPC3 and proliferation (Ki-67) to exclude an embryonal or mixed component",
    "Beta-catenin (CTNNB1) localization and GLUL zonation pattern to evaluate Wnt activation typical in hepatoblastoma",
    "Functional assays of hepatocyte metabolism: urea synthesis (CPS1), ketogenesis (HMGCS2), and CYP2E1 activity",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex IHC to detect architectural heterogeneity and rule out macrotrabecular/mixed patterns"
