  "Cluster": "3",
  "CandidateSubtype": "fetal",
  "TopGenes": [
    "ADH1B",
    "GLUL",
    "HSP90AA1",
    "HSPA1A",
    "CYP2E1",
    "REG3A",
    "MALAT1",
    "MT-RNR2",
    "APOC1",
    "APCS"
  ],
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "ADH1B is involved in ethanol metabolism, which is a characteristic of fetal liver cells.",
    "GLUL is involved in ammonia detoxification, a function of mature hepatocytes, indicating a more differentiated, fetal-like state.",
    "HSP90AA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that are typically upregulated in response to stress, which could be indicative of the tumor environment.",
    "CYP2E1 is involved in drug metabolism and is typically expressed in mature hepatocytes, again suggesting a more differentiated, fetal-like state.",
    "REG3A is a hepatocytic growth factor that could be involved in the proliferation of the tumor cells.",
    "MALAT1 and MT-RNR2 are non-coding RNAs that have been associated with various cancers, including hepatoblastoma.",
    "APOC1 and APCS are involved in lipid metabolism, a function of mature hepatocytes, indicating a more differentiated, fetal-like state."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of these genes at the protein level.",
    "Perform functional studies to determine the role of these genes in the growth and survival of the tumor cells.",
    "Investigate the potential of these genes as therapeutic targets."
