    "Strong ECM/CAF signature with collagens and proteoglycans (COL1A1/1A2/3A1/5A2/6A2/6A3, LUM, DCN, VCAN, MGP) indicating activated stromal fibroblasts.",
    "Matricellular proteins POSTN, SPARC, IGFBP7, FSTL1 are characteristic of mesenchymal components seen in mixed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal hepatoblastoma.",
    "VIM expression supports mesenchymal/CAF identity rather than epithelial tumor cells.",
    "CXCL14 suggests stromal\u2013immune crosstalk typical of CAF-rich, mesenchyme-containing regions.",
    "Lack of epithelial hepatoblastoma markers (e.g., AFP, EPCAM, DLK1, KRT8/18) argues against fetal or embryonal epithelial clusters; macrotrabecular is primarily an epithelial architectural pattern."

    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex RNA-ISH (e.g., RNAscope) for POSTN/COL1A1 and EPCAM/AFP to map stroma\u2013epithelium organization.",
    "Assess TGF-\u03b2 pathway activation in fibroblasts (pSMAD2/3 staining) and myofibroblast markers.",
    "Validate CXCL14 protein (IHC/ELISA) and profile neighboring immune cells by flow cytometry or imaging mass cytometry."
