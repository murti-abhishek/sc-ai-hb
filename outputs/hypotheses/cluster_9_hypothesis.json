  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Robust ECM/mesenchymal program (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL6A3, POSTN, SPARC, LUM, DCN) consistent with mesenchymal component of mixed hepatoblastoma.",
    "VIM and thymosin beta genes (TMSB4X/TMSB10) indicate cytoskeletal remodeling/EMT-like features rather than differentiated hepatocyte identity.",
    "S100A8/S100A9, DEFA3, CXCL14, and SRGN suggest inflammatory myeloid\u2013CAF interactions commonly seen in mixed tumors.",
    "Lack of canonical fetal hepatocyte markers (e.g., ALB, TTR, APOA genes, HNF4A) argues against fetal subtype.",
    "Absence of classic embryonal markers and cell-cycle genes (EPCAM, DLK1, LIN28B, MKI67/TOP2A) argues against embryonal subtype.",
    "Macrotrabecular is primarily architectural; the dominant mesenchymal/ECM signature better supports a mixed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal context."

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF panel for COL1A1, POSTN, SPARC, VIM, EPCAM, and ALB to define mesenchymal vs epithelial components.",
    "Co-stain CAF markers (FAP, PDGFRB) and myeloid/granulocyte markers (S100A8/A9, MPO) to profile stromal\u2013immune elements.",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex RNA-ISH for COL1A1/POSTN and S100A8/S100A9 to map localization within tumor.",
    "Infer CNVs from scRNA-seq to determine if this cluster is malignant versus stromal.",
    "\u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) IHC and AXIN2 RNA-ISH to assess Wnt pathway activity typical of hepatoblastoma.",
    "Masson's trichrome or picrosirius red staining to visualize collagen-rich/POSTN-positive stroma.",
    "Flow cytometry sorting of EPCAM+ versus THY1+/PDGFRB+ cells followed by transcriptomic profiling.",
    "3D collagen gel contraction or tumor\u2013CAF co-culture assays to test ECM remodeling functions."
