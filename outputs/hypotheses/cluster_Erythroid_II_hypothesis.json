  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Strong erythroid program (HBG1/HBG2/HBA1/HBA2, EPB41, TFRC) indicating erythroid-lineage features/infiltration",
    "Robust cell-cycle/mitotic signature (MKI67, STMN1, SMC4, TUBB) characteristic of less differentiated, rapidly dividing cells",
    "Activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin targets (APCDD1, NKD1) aligns with embryonal hepatoblastoma biology",
    "Absence of mature hepatocyte/fetal differentiation markers (e.g., ALB, CYPs) argues against fetal subtype"
