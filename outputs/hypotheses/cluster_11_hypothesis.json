    "Enrichment of endothelial/angiogenic markers (VWF, SPARCL1, IGFBP7, TM4SF1, EMP1, AKAP12) indicates tumor-associated vasculature.",
    "Strong extracellular matrix and fibroblast-like signature (COL1A1/COL1A2/COL3A1/COL4A1, LUM, SPARC, VIM, TMSB10) consistent with mesenchymal components.",
    "Lack of hepatocytic differentiation genes (ALB, TTR, CPS1, HNF4A) argues against a pure fetal phenotype.",
    "Absence of canonical epithelial/embryonal markers (AFP, EPCAM, KRT8/18, DLK1) argues against embryonal subtype.",
    "DNASE1L3 and IFI27 fit endothelial/interferon-responsive stromal cells typically found in HB stroma."

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Immunohistochemistry/IF for CD31 (PECAM1), VWF, ERG, SPARCL1 and CAF markers (COL1A1, LUM, FAP, PDGFRB) to validate endothelial/mesenchymal identity.",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex RNA ISH to localize these cells to perivascular/ECM-rich regions.",
    "InferCNV or scDNA-seq to distinguish non-malignant stroma from mesenchymal-differentiated malignant cells.",
    "Pathology review of H&E to confirm mixed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal features (e.g., fibroblastic/chondroid/osteoid areas).",
    "Flow cytometry (EPCAM\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD31+ and/or PDGFRB+) followed by bulk RNA-seq/ATAC-seq to validate cell identity and programs."
