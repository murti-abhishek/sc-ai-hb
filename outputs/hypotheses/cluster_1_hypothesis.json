  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Strong myeloid/inflammatory signature (S100A8/S100A9, IL1B, IL8, LYZ, SRGN, HLA-B/B2M).",
    "SPP1, TIMP1, CTSB, CLU suggest ECM remodeling/invasiveness consistent with heterogeneous tumor regions.",
    "Lack of hepatocyte differentiation markers (e.g., ALB, TTR, CPS1, GLUL, ASS1) argues against a pure fetal phenotype.",
    "Absence of prominent cell-cycle genes (e.g., MKI67, TOP2A) makes a purely embryonal identity less likely.",
    "Presence of HBB implies admixture with non-epithelial cells, supporting a heterogeneous/mixed context."

    "IHC/IF for EPCAM, AFP, KRT19, ALB, and SPP1 to map epithelial tumor vs stromal/immune components.",
    "IHC/flow for myeloid markers (CD68/CD163, S100A8/A9, LYZ; MPO) to validate inflammatory infiltration.",

    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex RNA-ISH for SPP1, IL1B, S100A8/A9, EPCAM.",
    "Re-cluster after removing immune cells; enrich/sort EPCAM+ cells to refine tumor subtype assignment.",
