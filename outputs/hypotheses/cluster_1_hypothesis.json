  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Upregulation of collagen genes (COL3A1, COL1A2, COL1A1, COL6A3) suggests a mesenchymal phenotype, which is characteristic of embryonal subtype.",
    "SPARC, a matricellular protein involved in tissue remodeling, is often upregulated in embryonal subtype.",
    "VIM (Vimentin) is a marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, supporting the embryonal subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry for COL1A1, COL1A2, and VIM to confirm the mesenchymal phenotype.",
    "Investigate the presence of other embryonal subtype markers, such as AFP, through qPCR.",
    "Perform single-cell RNA sequencing on additional tumor samples to validate these findings."
