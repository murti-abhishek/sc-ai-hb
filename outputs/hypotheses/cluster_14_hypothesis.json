  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Strong proliferation/cell-cycle signature (MKI67, STMN1, SMC4, TUBB) consistent with embryonal phenotype",
    "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway targets/regulators up (NKD1, APCDD1), characteristic of embryonal hepatoblastoma",
    "TFRC elevation aligns with rapidly dividing, less-differentiated tumor cells",
    "Lack of mature hepatocyte markers among top genes argues against fetal subtype",
    "Erythroid markers (HBG1/2, HBA1/2, EPB41) suggest erythroid contamination within this cluster"
