  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "APOB, SCD, FGL2, ATP1A1, and PDIA4 indicate hepatocyte metabolic/differentiation programs typical of fetal-like hepatoblastoma",
    "AFP and IGF2 are classic fetal liver/hepatoblastoma markers",
    "Wnt pathway targets (NKD1, APCDD1) align with HB biology and are compatible with fetal phenotype",
    "Relative absence of strong cell-cycle markers (e.g., MKI67, TOP2A) supports a more differentiated epithelial state",
    "ITGA6 reflects progenitor/fetal hepatocyte features without overt cholangioblastic signatures",
    "Secreted/regenerative factors (FST, REG3A) are consistent with fetal liver-like signaling milieu"
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF for AFP, HNF4A, ALB/APOB, and HepPar-1 to confirm hepatocyte-like fetal differentiation",
    "IHC for EPCAM and KRT19 to exclude embryonal/cholangioblastic features",
    "Assess Wnt activation: nuclear \u03b2-catenin IHC and AXIN2/NKD1 expression; sequence CTNNB1",
    "Ki-67 IHC to quantify proliferation index",
    "Metabolic assays (albumin secretion, urea production; lipid metabolism markers such as SCD activity)",
