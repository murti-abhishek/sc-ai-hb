  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Strong extracellular matrix/CAF program (COL1A2/COL5A2/COL6A1-3, LUM, FBLN1, SPARC, MMP2, CXCL14) consistent with mesenchymal components of mixed hepatoblastoma.",
    "Non-canonical WNT signaling (WNT5A) and matricellular factors (CYR61, IGFBP3) indicate stromal\u2013tumor crosstalk typical of mixed tumors.",
    "ANTXR1 and FGFR1 expression aligns with tumor-associated fibroblast/endothelial\u2013mesenchymal populations rather than pure epithelial fetal/embryonal cells.",
    "Absence of hepatocyte differentiation markers (e.g., ALB, TTR, APOA1) and classic cell-cycle drivers argues against fetal or embryonal dominance.",
    "TNFRSF11B suggests osteogenic/chondrogenic stromal features often seen in mixed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal HB."

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF for CAF markers (ACTA2/\u03b1SMA, FAP, PDGFR\u03b2) and epithelial markers (EPCAM, KRT8/18) to define cell identity and mixed phenotype.",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex RNA-ISH (WNT5A, LUM, COL1A2, SPARC) to map mesenchymal niches relative to tumor epithelium.",
    "Single-cell CNV inference (e.g., inferCNV) or scDNA to distinguish malignant from stromal cells.",
    "Ligand\u2013receptor analysis and co-culture perturbations (WNT5A or FGFR1 inhibition) to test stromal influence on tumor cells.",
    "Assess collagen deposition and MMP2 activity; evaluate response to TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibition to probe CAF programs."
