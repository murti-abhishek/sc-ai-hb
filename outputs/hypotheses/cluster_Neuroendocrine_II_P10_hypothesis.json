  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "The proliferation score is low, indicating a slow-growing tumor which is consistent with the embryonal subtype of hepatoblastoma.",
    "The stemness score is high, suggesting a high degree of pluripotency and self-renewal capacity. This is also characteristic of the embryonal subtype, which is known to contain immature, stem-like cells.",
    "The immune infiltration score is intermediate, suggesting some degree of immune cell infiltration into the tumor, but not to a high degree. This is consistent with the embryonal subtype, which can elicit an immune response, but not as strongly as some other subtypes.",
    "The prognostic signature score is very low, suggesting a favorable prognosis. This is consistent with the embryonal subtype, which generally has a better prognosis than other hepatoblastoma subtypes."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of embryonal markers in the tumor cells.",
    "Carry out functional assays to validate the high stemness score, such as sphere formation or colony formation assays.",
    "Investigate the immune microenvironment of the tumor using multiplex immunofluorescence to better understand the level and nature of immune infiltration.",
    "Validate the prognostic score using survival analysis in a larger cohort of hepatoblastoma patients."
