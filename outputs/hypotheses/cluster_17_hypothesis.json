  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Enrichment of hepatocyte secretory/metabolic genes (APOA1/A2, APOB, APOH, APOM, SERPINA1, SEPP1, F2) indicates a differentiated hepatocytic program.",
    "AHSG (fetuin-A) and AFP are classic fetal hepatocyte/oncofetal markers characteristic of fetal hepatoblastoma.",
    "Presence of lipid and amino-acid metabolism genes (ACSL4, ACADSB, LIPA, PSAP) aligns with hepatocyte functional maturation typical of the fetal subtype.",
    "DLK1 and PEG10 are oncofetal genes frequently expressed in hepatoblastoma and compatible with a fetal-like phenotype.",
    "Relative lack of cell-cycle markers with strong hepatic synthetic function supports a differentiated (fetal) state."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Immunohistochemistry: AFP, AHSG, DLK1, GPC3, HepPar-1 (CPS1) to confirm hepatocytic differentiation and oncofetal status.",
    "Assess Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation: nuclear \u03b2-catenin IHC and CTNNB1 mutation testing.",
    "Flow cytometry or IHC for EPCAM to help exclude an embryonal phenotype (typically EPCAM-high).",
    "Correlate with histology for fetal morphology (trabecular/rosette patterns with differentiated cytology); PAS for glycogen.",
    "Functional assays or ELISA for secreted apolipoproteins (APOA1/2, APOB) to validate hepatocyte-like function.",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or RNA-ISH (AFP, DLK1) to map fetal-like cells within the tumor."
