  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF: nuclear \u03b2-catenin, LEF1, TBX3; mesenchymal/osteochondral markers RUNX2, MATN3, SOX9; epithelial (EPCAM, KRT19) vs mesenchymal (VIM) markers",
    "Histochemical stains: Alcian blue (chondroid) and Alizarin red/von Kossa (osteoid) to confirm mixed differentiation",
    "Genetic/functional WNT assays: CTNNB1/AXIN1 sequencing and TCF/LEF reporter activity",
    "Spatial transcriptomics to map epithelial vs mesenchymal regions within the tumor",
    "Organoid derivation with WNT modulation; test SLC1A5 dependence using glutamine starvation or ASCT2 inhibitors"
