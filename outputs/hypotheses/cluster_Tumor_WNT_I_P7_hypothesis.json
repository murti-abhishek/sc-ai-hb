  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "The proliferation score is low (0.014), suggesting that the cells in this cluster are not rapidly dividing, which is characteristic of the embryonal subtype.",
    "The stemness score is intermediate (0.531), indicating a level of cell immaturity and plasticity, which is consistent with the embryonal subtype.",
    "The immune infiltration score is low (0.066), suggesting a lack of immune cell presence in the tumor environment, which is common in embryonal subtype.",
    "The prognostic signature score is very low (0.000), indicating a potentially favorable prognosis, which is often associated with the embryonal subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the lack of immune cell infiltration.",
    "Conduct functional assays to validate the stemness properties of the cells.",
    "Carry out in vivo studies to assess tumor growth rate and validate the low proliferation score.",
    "Perform gene knockdown studies to investigate the role of the top genes in tumor biology."
