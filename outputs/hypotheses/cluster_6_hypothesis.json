  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin targets and modulators (NOTUM, NKD1, APCDD1, TMEM9, TNFRSF19) are upregulated, characteristic of embryonal HB.",

    "Absence of mature hepatocyte metabolic markers (e.g., ALB, CYPs) argues against the fetal subtype.",
    "Cytoskeletal/adhesion genes (ENAH, CLDN11, SEPT9) align with invasive/progenitor programs seen in embryonal areas.",
    "Metabolic/stress reprogramming genes (PKM, GAPDH, NQO1, TXNRD1) fit embryonal-like tumor cell biology.",
    "VGLL4 suggests Hippo\u2013YAP pathway interplay typical in aggressive progenitor-like HB."
