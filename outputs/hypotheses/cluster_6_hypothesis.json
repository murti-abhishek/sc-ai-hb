  "Cluster": "6",

    "FGA",

    "C3",
    "HP",
    "FMO5",

  ],
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "FGA, FGB, and FGG are part of the fibrinogen complex, which is typically expressed in the liver and is associated with fetal liver development.",
    "CPS1 is involved in the urea cycle, which is active in the fetal liver.",
    "C3 and HP are acute phase proteins produced by the liver, often upregulated in fetal liver.",
    "FMO5 is involved in drug metabolism and is highly expressed in fetal liver.",
    "RELN is involved in neuronal migration and is typically expressed during fetal development.",
    "FN1 is involved in cell adhesion and migration, processes that are active during fetal development.",
    "PAH is involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine, a process that is active in the fetal liver."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of these genes at the protein level.",
    "Perform in situ hybridization to localize the expression of these genes within the tumor.",
    "Use CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out these genes and observe the effect on tumor growth and development.",
    "Perform single-cell RNA sequencing on different tumor regions to confirm the presence of this fetal subtype across the tumor."
