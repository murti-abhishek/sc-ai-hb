  ],
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "APOE, APOC3, and APOA1 are associated with lipid metabolism, a key feature of fetal hepatoblastoma subtype.",
    "HMGCS2 is involved in ketogenesis, a process active in fetal liver.",
    "CYP2E1 and ADH4 are involved in drug metabolism and alcohol dehydrogenation, respectively, which are functions of mature hepatocytes seen in the fetal subtype.",
    "FGA and FGG are involved in the coagulation cascade, which is active in the fetal liver."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry for APOE, APOC3, and APOA1 to confirm protein expression.",
    "Assess lipid metabolism in the tumor cells to confirm the fetal subtype.",
    "Perform functional assays to assess the activity of the coagulation cascade and drug metabolism pathways."
