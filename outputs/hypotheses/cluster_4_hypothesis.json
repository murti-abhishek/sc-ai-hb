  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Enrichment of mature hepatocyte metabolic genes (CYP2E1, BAAT, ADH1B, APOE/APOC1) indicates differentiated hepatocyte-like identity",
    "GLUL (glutamine synthetase) consistent with pericentral hepatocyte program and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin\u2013driven fetal hepatoblastoma regions",
    "Lack of progenitor/cholangioblastic markers (e.g., EPCAM, KRT19, DLK1) and cell-cycle genes argues against embryonal or macrotrabecular phenotypes",
    "Mitochondrial OXPHOS gene upregulation (MT-CO2, MT-CYB, MT-ATP6, MT-ND4) supports oxidative, hepatocyte-like metabolism",
    "Acute-phase/lipoprotein genes (APCS, APOE, APOC1) align with differentiated hepatic function"

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF for GLUL, CYP2E1, HepPar-1/ARG1 to confirm hepatocyte differentiation",
    "IHC for EPCAM, KRT19, DLK1 to exclude embryonal/cholangioblastic components",
    "Ki-67 staining to verify low proliferative fraction",
    "Assess \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) nuclear localization; test AXIN2 and sequence CTNNB1",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex IHC to map fetal-like regions within the tumor"
