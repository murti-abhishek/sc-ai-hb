  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Neuroendocrine markers (CHGA, CHGB, SCG3, SCGN) and TFs (INSM1, NEUROD1) indicate a primitive neuroendocrine-like program typical of embryonal HB.",
    "Absence of hepatocyte metabolic differentiation genes (e.g., ALB, TTR, APOs, CYPs) argues against a fetal phenotype.",
    "Developmental/neuronal regulators (SYT4, APLP1, BTBD3, NR2F1) align with a less-differentiated progenitor state.",
    "Profile lacks concurrent fetal signatures expected in mixed tumors, favoring a pure embryonal identity.",
    "Macrotrabecular denotes architectural pattern rather than this neuroendocrine transcriptional program."

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF for CHGA, CHGB, INSM1, synaptophysin; compare with AFP, DLK1, EPCAM (embryonal) and HNF4A, ALB, TTR, CYP3A7 (fetal).",
    "RNA ISH for INSM1 and NEUROD1 to validate neuroendocrine-like cells in situ.",
    "Ki-67 staining to quantify proliferation and correlate with the neuroendocrine-like cluster.",
    "Lineage marker panel (HNF4A/ALB for hepatocyte, KRT19/SOX9 for cholangiocyte) to exclude fetal/mixed phenotypes.",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplexed RNA profiling to map the neuroendocrine-like compartment.",
    "Sphere-formation or differentiation assays to functionally assess progenitor/stem-like behavior."
