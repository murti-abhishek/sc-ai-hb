  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Enrichment of hepatocyte metabolic/secretory genes (ALB, APOA1/A2/APOB/APOM, TF, AHSG, SERPINA1, ITIH2, F2, SERPINA6) consistent with differentiated hepatocyte-like identity",
    "Oncofetal markers AFP, DLK1, PEG10 characteristic of fetal hepatoblasts",
    "Lipid and mitochondrial metabolism genes (ACSL4, SCD, ACADSB) align with fetal hepatocyte program",
    "HBG2 indicates a fetal developmental state",
    "Absence of cholangiocyte/progenitor markers (EPCAM, KRT7, KRT19) argues against embryonal or mixed cholangioblastic components",
    "Lack of angiogenic/endothelial signatures argues against macrotrabecular phenotype"
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Immunostaining for AFP, ALB, and DLK1/PEG10 to confirm fetal hepatocyte-like phenotype",
    "Immunostaining for EPCAM and KRT19 to exclude embryonal/cholangioblastic components",
    "Ki-67 staining to quantify proliferation",
    "Assess Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation (AXIN2 qPCR; CTNNB1 mutation sequencing)",
    "Infer copy-number alterations from scRNA-seq or perform low-pass DNA sequencing",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex IF to evaluate tissue architecture and exclude macrotrabecular pattern"
