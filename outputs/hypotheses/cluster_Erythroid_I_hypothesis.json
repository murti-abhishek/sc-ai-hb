  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Dominant inflammatory myeloid markers (IL8, IL1B, S100A8, S100A9, LYZ, HLA-DRA, HLA-B, B2M) indicate immune infiltrate rather than epithelial tumor cells",
    "Erythroid/hemoglobin gene (HBB) suggests erythroid lineage presence within the cluster",
    "SRGN, CTSB, TIMP1, TNFAIP3 align with activated myeloid/granule biology",
    "SPP1 (osteopontin) often marks inflammatory/microenvironmental remodeling",
    "Lack of hepatoblastoma epithelial markers (e.g., ALB, AFP, EPCAM, KRT8/18, HNF4A) argues against a pure fetal/embryonal epithelial cluster",
    "Overall profile supports a non-epithelial, microenvironment-rich context consistent with mixed histology at the tumor level"

  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Immunostaining/spatial IHC for EPCAM/ALB/HNF4A vs CD68/LYZ/S100A8/S100A9 and hemoglobin to localize epithelial vs myeloid/erythroid cells",
    "Single-cell CNV/inferCNV to distinguish malignant epithelial cells from non-malignant immune/erythroid cells",
    "Subcluster and doublet removal analysis to separate erythroid and myeloid populations",
    "Spatial transcriptomics to map immune/erythroid niches relative to tumor epithelium",
    "Flow cytometry (EPCAM+ vs CD45+; CD14/CD16/FCGR3A; Glycophorin A) for cellular composition",
    "Cytokine/chemokine profiling (e.g., IL8, IL1B) and myeloid functional assays to assess inflammatory activity"
