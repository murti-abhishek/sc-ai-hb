  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Enrichment of hepatocyte metabolic genes (CYP2E1, BAAT, ADH1B, APOC1/APOE) consistent with differentiated fetal-like phenotype",
    "GLUL (glutamine synthetase) indicates pericentral/WNT-activated hepatocyte identity common in fetal hepatoblastoma",
    "Mitochondrial OXPHOS transcripts (MT-CO2, MT-CYB, MT-ATP6, MT-ND4) align with mature metabolic programs",
    "Lack of classic embryonal/high-proliferation markers (e.g., MKI67, TOP2A, CCNB1) among top genes",
    "REG3A, HLA-B, APCS reflect liver acute-phase/immune features but are not subtype-defining",
    "Heat-shock chaperones (HSP90AA1, HSPA1A) suggest stress response without contradicting fetal identity"

    "IHC/IF for GLUL, CYP2E1, BAAT, APOE/APOC1 to confirm hepatocyte differentiation",

    "Functional assays: urea production, bile acid conjugation (BAAT activity), CYP2E1 activity",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex IHC to correlate with fetal histology and detect mixed areas",
