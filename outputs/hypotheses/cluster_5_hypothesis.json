  ],
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "CHGB and CHGA are known to be associated with neuroendocrine differentiation, which is a characteristic of embryonal subtype.",
    "PKM is involved in glycolysis, which is often upregulated in rapidly proliferating cells like those in embryonal subtype.",
    "XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, which may suggest a female patient or a cell line with two X chromosomes, but it does not directly indicate a specific subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of neuroendocrine markers.",
    "Perform metabolic assays to confirm the upregulation of glycolysis.",
    "Perform karyotyping or FISH to confirm the X-chromosome status."
