  "PrognosticScore": "0.108",
  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "The proliferation score is low, indicating a slower rate of cell division, which is more characteristic of the embryonal subtype.",
    "The stemness score is intermediate, suggesting a degree of cellular differentiation, which is consistent with the embryonal subtype.",
    "The immune infiltration score is low, indicating a lack of immune response, which is typical for embryonal hepatoblastoma.",
    "The prognostic score is low, suggesting a better prognosis, which is more common in the embryonal subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of the top genes and validate the subtype assignment.",
    "Carry out functional studies to understand the role of these genes in tumor biology.",
    "Investigate the tumor microenvironment to understand the low immune infiltration score.",
    "Conduct longitudinal studies to validate the prognostic score."
