  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "WNT/\u03b2-catenin target and feedback genes (NOTUM, NKD1, APCDD1, TMEM9, TNFRSF19) indicate active WNT signaling typical of embryonal HB",
    "Progenitor/stem-associated markers (SOX4, NES) align with an immature embryonal phenotype",
    "Glycolytic/oxidative stress programs (PKM, GAPDH, NQO1, TXNRD1) fit less differentiated tumor cells",
    "Motility/EMT-related genes (ENAH, CLDN11) support a less differentiated, migratory state",
    "Growth and Hippo/YAP pathway interplay (HDGF, VGLL4) often seen in embryonal-like HB"
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Validate WNT activation: nuclear \u03b2-catenin IHC; qPCR for AXIN2/LGR5; TCF/LEF reporter assays",
    "Perturb WNT signaling: PORCN inhibitor (e.g., LGK974) or NOTUM blockade; assess viability and WNT target expression",
    "Profile lineage markers: IHC/flow for EPCAM, AFP, PROM1 versus fetal/hepatocyte markers (HNF4A, TTR, CYP3A4)",
    "Functional stemness assays: tumorsphere/organoid formation and limiting dilution",
    "Validate EMT/motility markers (ENAH, CLDN11) and progenitor markers (SOX4, NES) by IHC/IF; migration/invasion assays",
    "Single-cell trajectory and gene set scoring to compare embryonal vs fetal programs; infer CNVs to confirm tumor identity"
