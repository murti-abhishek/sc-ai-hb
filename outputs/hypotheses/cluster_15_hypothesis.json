    "Strong neuroendocrine/neuronal program (CHGA, CHGB, INSM1, NEUROD1, SCG3, SCGN, SYT4) typical of primitive embryonal-like cells",
    "Absence of mature hepatocyte markers (e.g., ALB, TTR, CYPs) argues against fetal subtype",
    "Developmental/immaturity cues (NR2F1, BTBD3) and neuronal cytoskeleton gene TUBA1A",
    "Secretory/vesicle and processing genes (PCSK1N, QPCT) and ECM component MFAP4 support tumor-cell identity over stromal/immune",
    "Signaling genes (GNAS, CACYBP) associated with progenitor-like pathways seen in embryonal hepatoblastoma"
