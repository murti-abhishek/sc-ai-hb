  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "Dominant hepatocyte differentiation/secretory program (ALB, APOB/APOA2/APOM, SERPINA1, TF, F2, SERPINA6, AHSG, ITIH2) consistent with fetal hepatocyte-like cells",
    "Fetal liver/hepatoblast markers enriched (AFP, DLK1, GPC3, PEG10)",
    "Lipid metabolism genes (ACSL4, SCD, ACADSB) indicate hepatocytic maturation rather than undifferentiated embryonal phenotype",
    "No biliary/ductal markers (e.g., KRT19, EPCAM, SOX9) apparent, arguing against mixed cholangioblastic components",
    "Top markers do not emphasize cell-cycle genes (e.g., MKI67, TOP2A), aligning with a more differentiated fetal subtype"
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "IHC/IF for ALB, AFP, GPC3, DLK1, and HNF4A to confirm fetal hepatocyte-like identity",
    "Assess biliary markers (KRT19, EPCAM, SOX9) to exclude mixed/embryonal components",
    "Evaluate Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation (nuclear \u03b2-catenin IHC; CTNNB1 mutation sequencing; GLUL/GS staining)",
    "Functional hepatocyte assays (LDL uptake, albumin/urea secretion) in tumor-derived organoids",
    "Spatial transcriptomics or multiplex IHC to assess architectural pattern and rule out macrotrabecular growth",
    "DNA methylation or bulk RNA-based HB subtype classifier to orthogonally validate fetal classification"
