  "SupportingEvidence": [
    "The proliferation score is low (0.214), indicating a slow-growing tumor which is consistent with the fetal subtype.",
    "The stemness score is also low (0.193), suggesting the cells are more differentiated, a characteristic of the fetal subtype.",
    "The immune infiltration score is intermediate (0.329), suggesting some immune response but not a high level of immune cell infiltration.",
    "The prognostic score is high (1.000), indicating a poor prognosis. This could be due to other factors such as tumor location or size, not necessarily the subtype.",
    "The top genes include AFP and ALB, which are markers for hepatoblastoma and more specifically the fetal subtype."
  ],
  "SuggestedExperiments": [
    "Perform immunohistochemistry to confirm the expression of the top genes, especially AFP and ALB.",
    "Carry out further genomic sequencing to identify any potential mutations or alterations that could be driving the high prognostic score.",
    "Conduct in vitro studies to understand the tumor's response to various chemotherapeutic agents."
